Lingua::Alphabet::Phonetic
==========================

Converts characters or strings to a phonetic alphabet.  
The most common phonetic alphabet is the U.S. Military / NATO standard
where "ABC...YZ" is pronounced "Alpha Bravo Charlie ... Yankee Zulu".
At present, that is the only alphabet available for conversion.
